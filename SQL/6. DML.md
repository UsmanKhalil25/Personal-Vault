#### INSERT
```Mysql
INSERT INTO table_name(col1,col2,col3) VALUES (val1,val2,val3)
```

#### UPDATE
```Mysql
UPDATE table_name SET col1 = 1, col2 = 'abc' WHERE id = 1;
```
- Updates multiple rows
	- UPDATE Student SET class = class+1
- ON UPDATE CASCADE
	- Can be added to the table while creating constraints. Suppose there is a situation where we have two tables such that primary key of one table is the foreign key for another table, if we update the primary key of the first table then using the ON UPDATE CASCADE foreign key of the second table automatically gets updated
#### DELETE
- DELETE FROM table_name WHERE id = 1;
- DELETE FROM table_name;(deletes all columns)
- ON DELETE CASCADE
	- ON DELETE CASCADE is **used to specify that when a row is deleted from the parent table, all rows in the child table that reference the deleted row should also be deleted**.
- ON DELETE SET NULL
	- The value of foreign key will be set to NULL but the other entries in that row would not delete
#### REPLACE
- Primarily used for already present data 
- If data is present it will be replaced
- If data is not present it will behave as INSERT command
```mysql
REPLACE INTO Customer(id,name)
VALUES (2, 'Janey Smith');
```
- If we are missing some columns in the replace statement they will be set to NULL similar to INSERT
```Mysql
REPLACE INTO Customer SET id = 1, address = '123 Main St, Cityville', gender = 'Male';
```
- UPDATE VS REPLACE
	- If data(row ) is present then both behave in the same way
	- If data is present REPLACE creates an new entry, while UPDATE does nothing
