- All RDBMS are relational in nature, we refer to other tables to get meaningful information
- Foreign Keys are used to establishing relations
#### Inner Join
- return a resultant table that has matching values from both the tables or all the tables
- basically the intersection of tables (common rows/tuples)
- the number of columns in the resultant table will be more ( sum of both tables)
- to apply join there should be a common attribute/key in tables

```Mysql
SELECT column-list FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON condition1
```
- Alias in MySQL
	- Aliases in MySQL is used to give a temporary name to a table or a column in a table for the purpose of a particular query.
	- SELECT column_name AS alias_name FROM table_name
	- SELECT column_name1, column_name2 FROM table_name AS alias_name

#### Outer Join
- Left Outer Join
	- Returns a resulting table that all the date form left table and the matched data from the right table
	- ![[left_join.png]]
```Mysql
SELECT columns FROM table LEFT JOIN table2 ON Join_conditions
```

- Right Outer Join
	- Returns a resulting table that all the date form right table and the matched data from the left table
- FULL JOIN
	- No keyword available for FULL JOIN
	- UNION
	- Returns a resulting table that contains all date when there is a match on left or right table data
```Mysql
SELECT columns FROM table1 as t1 LEFT JOIN as t2 On t1.id = t2.id
UNION
SELECT columns FROM table1 as t1 RIGHT JOIN table2 as t2 ON t1.id = t2.id
```

```Mysql
UNION ALL
```

- CROSS JOIN
	- Cartesian Product

- Self Join
