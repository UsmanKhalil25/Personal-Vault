### The `if` statement

The `if` statement allows us to check if an expression is equal to `true` or `false`, and execute different code according to the result.

For example, if we want to ask the user whether his name is "John", we can use the `confirm` function.

```javascript
if (confirm("Are you John Smith?"))
{
    console.log("Hello John, how are you?");
} else {
    console.log("Then what is your name?");
}
```

It is also possible to omit the `else` keyword if we only want to execute a block of code only if a certain expression is true.

### Loose equality and Strict equality

==To evaluate whether two variables are equal, the `==` operator is used. ==There is also another equality operator in JavaScript, `===`, which does a strict comparison. ==This means that it will be true only if the two things you are comparing are the same type as well as same content.==

```javascript
console.log("1" == 1); // true
console.log("1" === 1); // false
```

For example:

```javascript
var myNumber = 42;
if (myNumber == 42)
{
    console.log("The number is correct.");
}
```

Inequality operators can also be used to evaluate expressions. For example:

```javascript
var foo = 1;
var bar = 2;

if (foo < bar)
{
    console.log("foo is smaller than bar.");
}
```

Two or more expressions can be evaluated together using logical operators to check if two expressions evaluate to `true` together, or at least one of them. To check if two expressions both evaluate to `true`, use the AND operator `&&`. To check if at least one of the expressions evaluate to `true`, use the OR operator `||`.

```javascript
var foo = 1;
var bar = 2;
var moo = 3;

if (foo < bar && moo > bar)
{
    console.log("foo is smaller than bar AND moo is larger than bar.");
}

if (foo < bar || moo > bar)
{
    console.log("foo is smaller than bar OR moo is larger than bar.");
}
```

The NOT operator `!` can also be used likewise:

```javascript
var notTrue = false;
if (!notTrue)
{
    console.log("not not true is true!");
}
```

### The `switch` statement

The `switch` statement is similar to the `switch` statement from the C programming language, but also supports strings. The `switch` statement is used to select between more than two different options, and to run the same code for more than one option. For example:

```javascript
switch (new Date().getDay()) {  
  case 0:  
    day = "Sunday";  
    break;  
  case 1:  
    day = "Monday";  
    break;  
  case 2:  
     day = "Tuesday";  
    break;  
  case 3:  
    day = "Wednesday";  
    break;  
  case 4:  
    day = "Thursday";  
    break;  
  case 5:  
    day = "Friday";  
    break;  
  case 6:  
    day = "Saturday";  
}
```

Using the `switch` statement in general is not recommended, because forgetting the `break` keyword causes very confusing results.
