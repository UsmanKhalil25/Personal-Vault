JavaScript is a functional language, and for object oriented programming it uses both objects and functions, but objects are usually used as a data structure, similar to a dictionary in Python or a map in Java.

==In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.==

- Booleans can be objects (if defined with the `new` keyword)
- Numbers can be objects (if defined with the `new` keyword)
- Strings can be objects (if defined with the `new` keyword)
- Dates are always objects
- Maths are always objects
- Regular expressions are always objects
- Arrays are always objects
- Functions are always objects
- Objects are always objects

==All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.==
## JavaScript Primitives
	
- A **primitive value** is a value that has no properties or methods.
	- **3.14** is a primitive value
- A **primitive data type** is data that has a primitive value.
JavaScript defines 7 types of primitive data types:
## Examples

- `string`
- `number`
- `boolean`
- `null`
- `undefined`
- `symbol`
- `bigint`

## Immutable

Primitive values are immutable (they are hardcoded and cannot be changed).
if x = 3.14, you can change the value of x, but you cannot change the value of 3.14.


To initialize an object, use curly braces:

```javascript
var emptyObject = {};
var personObject = {
    firstName : "John",
    lastName : "Smith"
}
```

### Member addressing

Members of objects can be addressed using the brackets operator `[]`, very much like arrays, but just like many other object oriented languages, the period `.` operator can also be used. 

For example, we can continue to fill the person object with more details:

```javascript
var personObject = {
    firstName : "John",
    lastName : "Smith"
}
personObject.age = 23;
personObject["salary"] = 14000;
```

### Nested Objects
``` javascript
// nested object
const student = { 
    name: 'John', 
    age: 20,
    marks: {
        science: 70,
        math: 75
    }
}

// accessing property of student object
console.log(student.marks); // {science: 70, math: 75}

// accessing property of marks object
console.log(student.marks.science); // 70
```

### Object Methods

```Javascript
const person = {
    name: "Usman",
    age: 20,
    // using function as a value
    greet: function() { console.log('hello') }
}

person.greet(); // hello
```
