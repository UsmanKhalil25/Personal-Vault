1. **Mean (Average)**: The mean is just the average of a set of numbers. You add up all the numbers and then divide by how many numbers there are.

2. **Standard Deviation**: Standard deviation tells you how spread out the numbers in a set are from the mean. 

   - If the standard deviation is low, it means most of the numbers are close to the mean.
   
   - If the standard deviation is high, it means the numbers are spread out over a wider range from the mean.
   
So, in an easy way to relate it with mean: Think of the mean as the center of a group of numbers, and the standard deviation as a measure of how much those numbers tend to stray from that center. If the standard deviation is small, it means the numbers tend to be close to the mean. If it's large, the numbers are more spread out.
